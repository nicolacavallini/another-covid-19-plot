# Another covid-19 plot

Source code for the website [another covid-19 plot](https://sites.google.com/view/covid-19-another-plot/home). The code is messy it is a side-project. Plus is my first [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html) application.

Data are the ones provided by the [Italian civil protection department](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19).
